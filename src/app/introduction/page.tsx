            I&apos;m Anirudh Pottammal, a math and computer science student
            based in NYC. I&apos;m passionate about the intersection of
            mathematics, programming, and finance.

          <p className="text-xl text-white mb-6 leading-relaxed">
            My interests span across various fields including probabilistic
            systems, combinatorial optimization, machine learning, and
            quantitative finance. I enjoy solving complex problems and building
            innovative solutions.
          </p>

          <p className="text-xl text-white mb-6 leading-relaxed">
            When I&apos;m not coding or solving math problems, I practice magic
            tricks and explore the city. I believe in continuous learning and
            applying theoretical knowledge to practical challenges.

            Feel free to explore my projects or reach out if you&apos;d like to
            collaborate on interesting problems!
